I went to Argentina for almost 2 weeks in December 2024. I haven't really written a trip recap so here we go!

I landed at EZE airport and was greeted with the longest immigration line I have ever been a part of in my entire life. Waited for almost 2 hours but finally managed to get out of the Airport and make my way to Buenos Aires. 
On the Uber towards the city I created a note on my phone to write down my random thoughts throughout the trip. "first glance it kind of reminds me of LA. it's so green and nice." "license plate are 3 letters then 2 numbers" (in retrospect that is probably the opposite of what LA is like lol, and i don't). It was quite hot, and I made an attempt to get cash from a local ***cambio*** but couldn't find where I was on the map. Onwards to the hostel. I stayed at [*Che Juan Hostel*](https://www.chejuanhostel.com/?lang=en) in *Centro*. They had one of those old-timey elevators which was lovely. 
Freshened up and then found another **cambio**. It felt so illegal, and it honestly probably could've been? I traded USD for ARS at a jewelry store, and they gave me back all 500 peso notes - the equivalent of 50 cents in USD. I felt like a money launderer. 
Wads of cash in hand, I made my way towards *Plaza de Mayo* and sat at [Pertutti](https://www.pertutti.com.ar/) for a tea and some *papas fritas*, and to indulge in my favorite past time - people-watching. I enjoyed observing peoples outfits. I somehow had a lot of thoughts on my mind (esp semi-fresh out of a breakup) and scribbled my thoughts in my journal. 
Started walking towards *Puerto Madero* to walk by some water, and the employee at the hostel said this is where all of the young people hang out. 
It reminded me of South Beach but in the sense that it felt almost totally separated from the rest of the city, and with almost every building constructed in the last 30 years. Super modern neighborhood filled with tons of bars and restaurants. It was here that I discovered that HH in Buenos Aires started at 7pm and ended at 9pm (uh-may-zing). 
Sat by the water for a second and got an Oreo-coated soft-serve from McDonalds because it looked so yummy in the heat. On the North End of the docks there is a lovely art gallery, *Colecci√≥n de Arte Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat*
